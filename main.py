# The higher the velocity, the more noise in the measurements? (a = [2,0])
# Not true, a = [2,2] doesn't have a lot of noise.
# This might also link with lower dt corresponding to more noise.
# Has something to do with the amount acceleration compared to velocity (relatively smaller a -> more noise).
# a = [0, 0] has a high noise???

# Seems to be a bug somewhere, the measurements are not perfect without noise. Maybe it's normal: a straight path
# has a lot less deviation in the measurement compared to a curving path.

# Explain kind of lag in changing velocity direction (seems to stay the same while changing dt)
# Explain more noise in later part of curving path
# Lower dt -> more noise (why? maybe because velocity grows slower?)

# In general, noise seems to get worse the longer the path goes on. Why? Even though measurement noise is the same, the
# increased velocity probably causes the high noise in the later stages of the path.

# Main problem:
# The changes in position need to be small every timestep, but this means that noise in the distance and velocity
# measurements hit extremely hard.
